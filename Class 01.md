### Introduction:
####  About this book:

Many books that teach HTML and CSS 
resemble dull manuals. To make it easier for 
you to learn, we threw away the traditional 
template used by publishers and redesigned 
this book from scratch.

In this book it focussed 90% on coding; how we can write it and using it.
10% you can google it.

Understanding HTML and CSS 
can help anyone who works 
with the web; designers can 
create more attractive and 
usable sites, website editors can 
create better content, marketers 
can communicate with their 
audience more effectively, and 
managers can commission 
better sites and get the best out 
of their teams.


#### How the web works:

People access websites using 
software called **a web browser**. 
Popular examples include 
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, 
Chrome, and Opera.

When you ask your browser for 
a web page, the request is sent 
across the Internet to a special 
computer known as  **a web 
server** which hosts the website.

Web servers are special 
computers that are constantly 
connected to the Internet, and 
are optimized to send web pages 
out to people who request them.

**Screen readers** are programs 
that read out the contents of a 
computer screen to a user. They 
are commonly used by people 
with visual impairments.

People are accessing websites 
on an increasing range of **devices** 
including desktop computers, 
laptops, tablets, and mobile 
phones. It is important to 
remember that various devices 
have different screen sizes and 
some have faster connections to 
the web than others.
