# Chapter 2: Text
### Headings and paragraphs
#### Headings
HTML has six "levels" of 
headings:

<h1> is used for main headings.


<h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections 
under the subheadings then the 
<h3> element is used, and so 
on..


#### Paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.

#### Bold & Italic
By enclosing words in the tags 
<b> and </b> we can make 
characters appear bold.

The <b> element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
presented in a visually different 
way (for example key words in a 
paragraph) although the use of 
the <b> element does not imply 
any additional meaning.

By enclosing words in the tags 
<i> and </i> we can make 
characters appear italic.

#### Superscript & Subscrip
The <sup> element is used 
to contain characters that 
should be superscript such 
as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts like 
raising a number to a power such 
as 2^2.

The <sub> element is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas such as H20.

#### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
As you have already seen, the 
browser will automatically show 
each new paragraph or heading 
on a new line. But if you wanted 
to add a line break inside the 
middle of a paragraph you can 
use the line break tag <br />.

To create a break between 
themes — such as a change of 
topic in a book or a new scene 
in a play — you can add a 
horizontal rule between sections 
using the <hr /> tag.

#### Strong & Emphasis
The use of the <strong>
element indicates that its 
content has strong importance. 
For example, the words 
contained in this element might 
be said with strong emphasis.

The <em> element indicates 
emphasis that subtly changes 
the meaning of a sentence.

#### Quotations
The <blockquote> element is 
used for longer quotes that take 
up an entire paragraph. Note 
how the <p> element is still 
used inside the <blockquote>
element.

#### Abbreviations & Acronyms
If you use an abbreviation or 
an acronym, then the <abbr>
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is 
used to specify the full term.
