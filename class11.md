## Images 

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Controlling the size and alignment of 
your images using CSS keeps rules that 
affect the presentation of your page in 
the CSS and out of the HTML markup

**Image Size - Width and Height**

You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

Example:

`<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">`

### alining images using css

In the last chapter, you saw how the float property can be used to move an element to the left or 
the right of its containing block, allowing text to flow around it.

### Centering images using css

by using display :bluck proparty 

### background image 

we have some proparties:
1. background-image
2. background-repeat
3. background-attachment
4. background-position


### shorthand background

The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position

CSS3 will also support the use of multiple background images by repeating the background shorthand. Because few browsers supported this property at the time of writing, it was not commonly used.


`div {
 background:
 url(example-1.jpg)
 top left no-repeat,
 url(example-2.jpg) 
 bottom left no-repeat, 
 url(example-3.jpg) 
 centre top repeat-x;}`

The first image is shown on top, with the last one on the bottom.

### image rollover and sprits

Using CSS, it is possible to create 
a link or button that changes to a 
second style when a user moves 
their mouse over it (known as a 
rollover) and a third style when 
they click on it.

### CSS3: Gradients

CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.

**The Basics**

Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics 
that your website covers.

**On-Page Techniques**

On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your 
web pages to improve their rating in search engines.
1.  Page Title
2. RL / Web Address
3.  Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6.  Link Text
7. Page Descriptions


**Off-Page Techniques**

Getting other sites to link to you 
is just as important as on-page 
techniques. Search engines help 
determine how to rank your 
site by looking at the number of 
other sites that link to yours.

### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases

Before searching for information, you need to identify keywords related to your topic. The keywords you use have an impact on the results of your research. 

Keywords and phrases can easily be found by scanning . . .

**your initial research questions**
encyclopedia and other articles used when conducting background research
bibliographies found at the end of books and articles
If you are still struggling, try these suggestions:

**Use a thesaurus to identify synonyms**
Find pictures related to your topic, then describe the picture
Brainstorm keywords with a librarian, your instructor, or a friend

### Analytics: Learning about your Visitors

Visitor behavior analysis is a method of conducting qualitative research on visitors’ website behavior. Visitor behavior analysis involves employing multiple qualitative tools that help you track your website’s performance, understand website visitors’ on-site behavior, identify experience breakages, connect with individual visitors for feedback and suggestions, and then utilize all the insights to optimize the site-wide experience.
