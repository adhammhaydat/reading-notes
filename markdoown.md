# Markdown language

## what is markdown
* Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation. Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.

## how we can write a markdown
* There are two ways to format code in Markdown. You can either use inline code, by putting backticks (`) around parts of a line, or you can use a code block, which some renderers will apply syntax highlighting to

## Why You Should Use Markdown

* Above all, Markdown does what it was designed to do: it provides a simple, fast environment that lets you get straight to the writing. You can quickly format text in any editor on any platform without even letting your mouse get in the way.

## Why Is markdown better than Word?
* With Word you have tens or even hundreds of buttons to do different kinds of formatting. With Markdown it's much easier as it only supports limited features and you can easily learn the syntax in less than an hour. Limited features also means, most of the time, more readable and structured output. File size.
