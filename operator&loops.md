#### What are the loops in JavaScript?
Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false . You can type js for , js while or js do while to get more info on any of these.

Loops are control structures used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met. Visual Basic has three main types of loops:

1. for.. next loops,
2. do loops
