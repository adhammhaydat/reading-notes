### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

First of all, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, it's just that they require little maintenance for it. All SQL based databases are very stable, and are in production since years

### What does SQL stand for?

`stands for Structured Query Language`

### What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. ... The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.


### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.

### What is a ‘schema’?
A database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database.

### What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL, also referred to as “not only SQL” or “non-SQL,” is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases.

### What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

oSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have
