# Pain vs. Suffering

## Pain:

if you need to learn anything in any feild you will feel the pain, do not wary about that, that is the praice of learning 

**The main idea of pain is: no pain no gains**

Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

1. What’s your perspective?
i think that is good for me to get what i need 

2. Why are you doing this? in the simple awnser, to improve my self in programming feild

3. Do you want what comes at the end of this journey? Yes,yeeep and yeah

4. Are you doing this for you? yes of course

## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

### algorithm
what is the algorithm?

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.



### O(1)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

### o(n)
An algorithm is said to take linear time, or O(n) time, if its time complexity is O(n). Informally, this means that the running time increases at most linearly with the size of the input. More precisely, this means that there is a constant c such that the running time is at most cn for every input of size n.


### O(N²)
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴) etc.

### O(2^N)

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2^N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers:

int Fibonacci(int number){

    if (number <= 1) return number;
       
    return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1); 
}
