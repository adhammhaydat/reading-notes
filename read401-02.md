# Testing and Modules

## Testing:

### Unit tests and TDD

Unit test is the piece of code to check the input,output and the process behaviour 

whta we shlould do to test unite:
1. Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
2. Act:exercise the behaviour
3. Assert: to chick expected output 

#### The Cycle to test:
1. Write a unit test and make it fail 
2. Write the feature and make the test pass! 
3. Refactor the code


## What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?

is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported

Why Do we need it?
1. each module in python have uniqe name (`__name__`) and if `__name__ == __main__` that is mean you run exact module
2. and use it to execute some code if it emport in the deferant module 


## Recursion

### What is Recursion? 
a function calls a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem, and it is define in A Mathematical Interpretation

example: like to sorting some arrays

#### What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion? 

direct: only one function is called by itself

indirect: more than one function are by the other function and number of times
