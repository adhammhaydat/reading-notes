# FileIO & Exceptions

## Reading and Writing Files in Python (Guide)

### What Is a File?
a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data.

file systems are composed of three main parts:
```
1. Header: like file name, size, type, and so on
2. Data: contant of file
3. End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file
```

**File Paths**
parts of path: folder Path, name and extension 

### Opening and Closing a File in Python

to open file in python
```
with open('file-name.txt','r'||'w'||'rb' or 'wb') as reader
```
'r':Open for reading (default)

'w': Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first

'rb' or 'wb':Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)

### Reading and Writing Opened Files

to read:
```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
    
    print(reader.read())

```

to write:
```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
    
    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()

with open('dog_breeds_reversed.txt', 'w') as writer:
    for breed in reversed(dog_breeds):
        writer.write(breed)
```

## Python Exceptions: An Introduction

type of exception:
1. KeyError :Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
2. ZeroDivisionError :Raised when the second operand of a division or module operation is zero.
3. ZeroDivisionError: Raised when the second operand of a division or module operation is zero.
4. The IndexError :is thrown when trying to access an item at an invalid index.
5. The ValueError is thrown when a function's argument is of an inappropriate type.
6. Syntax Errors

example of exception:
```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
    print('The linux_interaction() function was not executed')
```
