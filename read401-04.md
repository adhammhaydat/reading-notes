# Readings Class:04

## Classes and Objects

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

print(myobjectx.variable)
print(myobjectx.function)
```
1. Accessing Object Variables:
inside the class we have a aariable and we can access it by using name of class and dotnotation,and also we can do some changes on variable
1. Accessing Object Functions
if we want to access the meethod inside class we can do it by name the class and then dotnotation 

## Thinking Recursively in Python

### Naive Recursion is Naive

let us implemnt this on fibonacci numbers `Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2`

1. we should check the base cases
```
if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
```
we do this step because the recartion function go to the root or base to get the first value to complete the calculations as showing below
```
else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```

## Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage

Fixtures: You'll want to have some objects available to all of your tests,they might involve the network or filesystem


In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition.

lets go to explain it with example:

1. if you want to read file and reverse each line your code will be:
```
def reverse_lines(f):
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
           for one_line in f]
```
2. using `StringIO` to create a fixture that'll provide your test with the appropriate object at the right time:
```
@pytest.fixture
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```
1. if you want to run the fixture more than on time you will use `scope` in `@pytest.fixture` to be like this:
```
@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))

```
