# Implementation: Linked Lists

## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function,This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:
1. run time : the amount time to running algorithm 
2. space: The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

to analyzing big o we shoud consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:
1. Input Size: he size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm
2. Units of Measurement: evaluate a function for Time and Space complexity

the Running Time:
 - The time in milliseconds from the start of a function execution until it ends
 - The number of operations that are executed
 - The number of “Basic Operations” that are executed
In order to quantify Memory Space
 - The amount of space needed to hold the code for the algorithm.
 - space of input
 - space of outout 
 - working space

## Linked Lists
### What is a Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other

`The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop`

```
while(next != null):
------
```
# Types of Linked list
1. Singly Linked list.
2. Doubly Linked list.
3. Circular Linked list.
4. Doubly Circular Linked list.

### Linear data structures

deferent between array and linked list is
if i need to store array with 7 element it take 7 bytes, but linked list need just 1 bytes.
