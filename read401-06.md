## How to use Random Module
- The random module provides access to functions that support many operations.
- we use it to generate a random number between a list of item

### How we can use a Random module

the random module contain some method to select a random things from list, as listed below:

1. Randint: we can use it to get random number from two numbers, this function accepte tow parameter.
example:
```
import random
print(random.randint(0,5))
expected output will be between 0 to 5
```
2. Choice: this function use to chose element from list of element.example
```
if we have this list:
list_item=['adham','dario','rania','ASAC','LTUC']

print(random.choice(list_item))

expected outout-->one item from this list(list_item)
```
3. Shuffle: this function to change the order of item in the list

4. Randrange: Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
example:
```
import random
for i in range(3):
    print (random.randrange(0, 15, 1))
thier is no expected output but maybe you will get 11,11,8 
```


## What is Risk Analysis

Risk analysis in software testing is an approach to software testing where software risk is analyzed and measured. ... A software risk analysis looks at code violations that present a threat to the stability, security, or performance of the code.

### Why use Risk Analysis?

We use it to identify all cases that may cause a risk to the system, and when identified, preventive measures are taken to preserve the integrity of the system from failure, for example when the site is hosted on a server and this server receives only 1000 visitors per hour and to avoid the danger that can occur due to the increase of this  We are adding a backup server to deal with this situation.

### Risk Identification

1. Business Risks: the risk will come frome your company of customer
2. Testing Risks: the risk will come by using the wrange tools to test your software
3. Premature Release Risk: not doing enough testing
4. Software Risks: each virsion for each software have alimit of functions that can be doing

### The perspective of Risk Assessment

1. Effect: determine how the risk will effect on your software

2. Cause: To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect, go and find the risk

3. Likelihood: there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.


## Test Coverage


Test coverage is defined as a metric in Software Testing that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test. It will include gathering information about which parts of a program are executed when running the test suite to determine which branches of conditional statements have been taken.

for do test coverage:
we should create unit test for each functions in the software to check if all functions will run successfully or not
i can say my software cover the requirment test when it pass  in range 70-80% of all test unit or more
