## Global

the scope is the area that can define variables inside this area and use it

1. Global scope: The means  you define in this scope are available and you can use it anywhere in your code.
2. Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.


In Python, global keyword allows you to modify the variable outside of the current scope. It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.

**global variables are generally bad practice and should be avoided.**

We declare a variable **global** by using the keyword global before a variable. 



## Nonlocal

Nonlocal is similar in meaning to global,but t means `not a global or local variable.`

A nonlocal variable has to be defined in the enclosing function scope. If the variable is not defined in the enclosing function scope, the variable cannot be defined in the nested scope.
