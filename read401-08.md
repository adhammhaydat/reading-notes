## List Comprehensions in Python

**List comprehension** offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

### Create a List with range()
Syntax:
```
digits = [x for x in range(10)]
```

### Create a List Using Loops and List Comprehension in Python

syntax:
```
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

### Multiplying Parts of a List

**Multiplication with list comprehensions**

```
multiples_of_three = [ x*3 for x in range(10) ]
```

### Show the first letter of each word using Python

```
authors = ["Ernest Hemingway","Langston Hughes","Frank Herbert","Toni Morrison",
    "Emily Dickson","Stephen King"]

# create an acronym from the first letter of the author's names
letters = [ name[0] for name in authors ]
print(letters)
```
### Using functions in list comprehensions

```
def double(x):
    return x*2

nums = [double(x) for x in range(1,10)]
```
### Reading a poem with list comprehensions

```
file = open("dreams.txt", 'r')
poem = [ line for line in file ]

```
