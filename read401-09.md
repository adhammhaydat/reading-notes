## Dunder Methods

Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name.
for example __init__ or __str__.


dunder methods short cut for under-under-method-under-under

some example on dunder method:
1. Object Representation: __str__, __repr__
2. Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__:
    * when we want to print len(class) python tell me there is an error(TypeError) but when use `__len__` to return number of element it will be fine
    * if we want to know the position of an element in class we use `__getitem__` to prevent error(TypeError)
    * to print all element in class in revers format we use `__reversed__`    
3. Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__: we use it to comper betwen two object 
4. Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__:
to marge two object
5. Callable Python Objects: __call__: that is mean when calling the object or class do the following(the statments isnid __call__ method/instance) 
6. Context Manager Support and the With Statement: __enter__, __exit__: to allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to


## Statistics - Probability

In the broad sense, a PROBABILITY is a measure of the degree to which an occurrence is certain [or uncertain]. A statistical definition of probability. People have thought about, and defined, probability in different ways.


### The data and the distribution

The normal distribution refers to a particularly important phenomenon in the realm of probability and statistics.

A simple and commonly used plot to quickly check the distribution of a sample of data is the histogram. In the histogram, the data is divided into a pre-specified number of groups called bins. The data is then sorted into each bin and the count of the number of observations in each bin is retained.

### Revisiting the normal
1. Central Limit Theorem
    A simulation to explain Central Limit Theorem: even when a sample is not normally distributed, if you draw multiple samples and take each of their averages, these averages will represent a normal distribution.

2. Three Sigma Rule
    The Three Sigma rule dictates that given a normal distribution, 68% of your observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% will fall within two, and 99.7% will fall within three. ... Any value that is more than three standard deviations away from the mean should be treated with caution or care.
