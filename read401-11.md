# Data Analysis

## What is Jupyter Lab

What is Jupyter Lab:
JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.

## NumPy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

### Lists Of Lists for CSV Data

Call the list type to get all the rows from the file.

delimiter ";" to split the text
```
with open('winequality-red.csv', 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'))
print(wines[:3])    
```

### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays:

#### Creating A NumPy Array:

```
in addtional to last code
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
```
#### Alternative NumPy Array Creation Methods:
to create an array with fixd size to use it leater
```
empty_array = np.zeros((3,4))
3 means? 3 rows
4 means? 4 columns
now we have an empty array with 3 rows and 4 columns
```
#### Using NumPy To Read In Files:
```
wines = np.genfromtxt("winequality-red.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=1)
genfromtxt: this is a function to read from file
```

#### Slicing NumPy Arrays:
if we need to slicing an array example:
if we need to determin a first 3 rows and first 2 columns the code will be:
```
wines[0:3,0:2]
```

#### NumPy Array Methods:

`wines.sum(axis=0)` : to give the sum of all the first rows
axios: using to determine how rows you would like to sum it
