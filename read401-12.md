# 10 minutes to pandas

Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.

## Object creation

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

#Creating a Series by passing a list of values
s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])

```
also we can create a dateframe by passing a dict of objects that can be converted to series:
```
df2 = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "A": 1.0,
        "B": pd.Timestamp("20130102"),
        "C": pd.Series(1, index=list(range(4)), dtype="float32"),
        "D": np.array([3] * 4, dtype="int32"),
        "E": pd.Categorical(["test", "train", "test", "train"]),
        "F": "foo",
    }
)

```
## Viewing data:
```
df.head()
df.tail()
df.index
df.columns
describe():shows a quick statistic summary of your data

```

## Selection:
### Getting:
```
df["A"]: selecting column A

df[0:3] selecting by index

df.loc[name of label]: selecting by lable ex:df.loc[dates]

df.iloc[num]: Selection by position

df[df["A"] > 0]: selecting be boolean indexing

df2[df2["E"].isin(["two", "four"])]: return all rows tha contain "two,four"[Using the isin() method for filtering]


```
### Setting:

to add new column
```
s1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], index=pd.date_range("20130102", periods=6)): to add new column by indexing

df.at[dates[0], "A"] = 0: by label

df.iat[0, 1] = 0: by position 

```

## Missing data

missig data that means i have nan value 

```
df1.dropna(how="any"): to drop missing value

df1.fillna(value=5): fill missing value

pd.isna(df1): to get the boolean mask where values are nan.

```
## Merge
```
Concat: 

pieces = [df[:3], df[3:7], df[7:]]

pd.concat(pieces)

Join: 
pd.merge(left, right, on="key")

```

## Grouping
```
Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria

Applying a function to each group independently

Combining the results into a data structure

df.groupby(["A", "B"]).sum() 
```
