# How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.


## 1.Step 1: Importing all the required libraries. import numpy as np. 
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import preprocessing, svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression


```
## 2.Step 2: Reading the dataset. 

```
cd C:\Users\Dev\Desktop\Kaggle\Salinity

# Changing the file read location to the location of the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('bottle.csv')
df_binary = df[['Salnty', 'T_degC']]

# Taking only the selected two attributes from the dataset
df_binary.columns = ['Sal', 'Temp']

# Renaming the columns for easier writing of the code
df_binary.head()

# Displaying only the 1st rows along with the column names

```
## 3.Step 3: Exploring the data scatter.

```
sns.lmplot(x ="Sal", y ="Temp", data = df_binary, order = 2, ci = None)

# Plotting the data scatter

```

## 4.Step 4: Data cleaning.
```
# Eliminating NaN or missing input numbers
df_binary.fillna(method ='ffill', inplace = True)

```
## 5.Step 5: Training our model.
```
X = np.array(df_binary['Sal']).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array(df_binary['Temp']).reshape(-1, 1)

# Separating the data into independent and dependent variables
# Converting each dataframe into a numpy array
# since each dataframe contains only one column
df_binary.dropna(inplace = True)

# Dropping any rows with Nan values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25)

# Splitting the data into training and testing data
regr = LinearRegression()

regr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(regr.score(X_test, y_test))

```
## 6.Step 6: Exploring our results.
```
y_pred = regr.predict(X_test)
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color ='b')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color ='k')

plt.show()
# Data scatter of predicted values

```

Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:

`lm.fit()` -> fits a linear model

`lm.predict()` -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients

`lm.score()`-> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
