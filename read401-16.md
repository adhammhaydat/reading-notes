# Machine Learning Intro
## Bird's Eye View

Machine learning is not about algorithms; Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems and the algorithm just uses to solve some problem it is a pices of puzzle

What makes machine learning so special?

the machine learining like a child in the first it will learn a small patterns and then as time passes on it will be smarter


### Key Terminology

1. Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
2. Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
3. Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
4. Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
5. Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
6. Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
7. Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

### Machine Learning Tasks

1. Supervised Learning:
    - labeled data: that mean what is the  correct answer
    - Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.
    - Classification is the task for modeling categorical
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - no labeled data: no correct answer
    - Clustering: for finding groups within your data

### The 3 Elements of Great Machine Learning

1. A skilled chef: teache the computer to learn our rules
2. Fresh ingredients: get a cleaning data
3. Don't overcook it: to avoid memorized the noise in the training set

#### The Blueprint
1. Exploratory Analysis
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering 
4. Algorithm Selection
5. Model Training

## Exploratory Analysis
In this section we have some question, these questions to determin the cleaning data set and to avoid a potantioal errer in tranning module 
How many observations do I have?
How many features?
What are the data types of my features? Are they numeric? Categorical?
Do I have a target variable?

after knowing the answers for these question you have to make Plot Numerical Distributions, Plot Categorical Distributions, Plot Segmentations and Study Correlations; this is the way to make a good model and to avoid any potantioal error  

## Data Cleaning
1. Remove Unwanted observations
2. Fix Structural Errors
3. Filter Unwanted Outliers
4. Handle Missing Data

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

Knowledge Infused Learning (K-IL): Towards Deep Incorporation of Knowledge in Deep Learning. ... A common substrate with careful integration of the two will raise opportunities to develop neuro-symbolic learning approaches for AI, where conceptual and probabilistic representations are combined.

Sparse classes (in categorical features) are those that have very few total observations. They can be problematic for certain machine learning algorithms, causing models to be overfit

Add Dummy Variables:
Most machine learning algorithms cannot directly handle categorical features. Specifically, they cannot handle text values.

### Remove Unused Features
Unused features are those that donâ€™t make sense to pass into our machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithm Selection

1. Size of the training data. It is usually recommended to gather a good amount of data to get reliable predictions. 
2. Accuracy and/or Interpretability of the output. 
3. Speed or Training time. 
4. Linearity. 
5. Number of features.

## Model Training
### How to Train ML Models
in the first you should have :
-  Exploring the data.
-  Cleaning the data.
-  Engineering new features.

1. Split Dataset
    - You can spend some of it to train your model 
    - You can spend some of it to evaluate (test) 
2. Cross-Validation: is a method for getting a reliable estimate of model performance using only your training data.
3. Fit and Tune Models:
