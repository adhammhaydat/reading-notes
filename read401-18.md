# Cryptography

## Encryption, decryption, and cracking

### Encrypting a message

her we will use the Caesar Cipher encryption techniques; that is mean which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount. 

```
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z

G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F
```
exampel if we need to encrypt this word "hello world" will be "nkrru cuxrj"

### Decrypting a message
we will use Caesar Cipher decrypting techniques 

```
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z

G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F
```
exampel if we need to decrypt this word "nkrru cuxrj" will be "hello world"

`Caesar always used a shift of 3`

### Cracking the cipher

There are three main techniques he could use: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.

#### frequency analysis

We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely

#### Known plaintext

For example, messages tend to start with similar beginnings. In WWII, encrypted German messages always started with a weather forecast, which ultimately made them easier for British mathematician Alan Turing to crack.

#### Brute force

There are only 25 possible shifts (not 26 â€” why not?). The enemy could take some time to try out each of them and find one that yielded a sensible message. They wouldn't even need to try the shifts on the entire message, just the first word or two.
