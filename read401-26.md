# Intro to Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.

### important command 
```
1. create django project: django-admin startproject name-of-project

2. craete django app: django-admin startapp name-of-app

3. run django server: python manage.py runserver

```
## Create first app with Django:

let's go to create app to print Hello, World

1. go to app folder
2. inside `view.py` file create function that accepted request and will return HttpResponse("Hello, world.") it is will look like this:
    * 
    ```
    from django.http import HttpResponse


    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world")
    ```
3. the create file that is call `urls.py`
4. insid this file we will do:
    * import `from django.urls import path` and
        `from . import views`
    * create list that is called `urlpatterns` your code will look like this:
    ```
    from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),]
    index: is your function that return Hello World

    ```  
5. go to `urls.py` in side project file and write this: `path('name the app/', include('the app.urls')),`

#don't forget to import include

your code will look like this: 

```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('name the app/', include('the app.urls'))]
```    
and then you can run your app by using: `python manage.py runserver`

## How Django works:

A Request/Response System. One way to describe Django is as a set of software components that aid in the receiving of web requests, and the returning of web responses. More simply, Django can accept requests for URLs like www.example.com, and return all of the HTML needed for a web browser to render a page.
