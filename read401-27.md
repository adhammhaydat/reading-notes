# Django Models

## Django Tutorial Part 3: Using models

### the relationships are :

1. one to many relationships
2. many to many relationships
3. one to one relationships

### How To Create Django Models

#### 1. Add the Posts Model

1. First we need to open and edit the models.py file so that it contains the code for generating a Post model.

2. your model should have this import 
    ```
    from django.db import models
    from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django.urls import reverse
    ```
3. add the class method on the model class we will be calling Post
    ```
    class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True, max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    author = models.TextField()
    ```  
4. we will add functionality for the generation of the URL and the function for saving the post.
    ```
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('blog_post_detail', args=[self.slug])

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.slug:
            self.slug = slugify(self.title)
        super(Post, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
    ```    
5. we need to tell the model how the posts should be ordered, and displayed on the web page.
    ```
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['created_on']

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.title
    ```      
6. we will add the Comment model to this file. This involves adding another class named Comment with models.Models in its signature and the following database fields defined:
    ```
    name — The name of the person posting the comment.
    email — The email address of the person posting the comment.
    text — The text of the comment itself.
    post — The post with which the comment was made.
    created_on — The time the comment was created
    ```
    the class will be:
    ```
    class Comment(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=42)
        email = models.EmailField(max_length=75)
        website = models.URLField(max_length=200, null=True, blank=True)
        content = models.TextField()
        post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    ```    
#### 2. Update Settings

add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS

#### 3. Make Migrations

write this command into your terminal:
`python manage.py migrate`

#### 5 Verify Database Schema

run this command in your terminal:
```
1. mysql blog_data -u djangouser

2. USE name-of-database

3. SHOW TABLES;

```
