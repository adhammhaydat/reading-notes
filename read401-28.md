# Django CRUD and Forms

## Working with forms

### HTML forms

In HTML, a form is a collection of elements inside `<form>...</form>` that allow a visitor to do things like enter text, select options, manipulate objects or controls, and so on, and then send that information back to the server.

### GET and POST

GET and POST are the only HTTP methods to use when dealing with forms.

Django handles three distinct parts of the work involved in forms:

- preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering
- creating HTML forms for the data
- receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client

### Building a form in your template(HTML)

```
<form action="/your-name/" method="post">
    <label for="your_name">Your name: </label>
    <input id="your_name" type="text" name="your_name" value="{{ current_name }}">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```

### Building a form class in form model in Django

```
from django import forms

class NameForm(forms.Form):
    your_name = forms.CharField(label='Your name', max_length=100)
```

### handle the form in view model:

```
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.shortcuts import render

from .forms import NameForm

def get_name(request):
    # if this is a POST request we need to process the form data

    if request.method == 'POST':

        # create a form instance and populate it with data from the request:
        
        form = NameForm(request.POST)
        
        # check whether it's valid:
        
        if form.is_valid():
            # process the data in form.cleaned_data as required
            # ...
            # redirect to a new URL:
           
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/')

    # if a GET (or any other method) we'll create a blank form
    
    else:
        form = NameForm()

    return render(request, 'name.html', {'form': form})
```

### now we will go to our template and modify it to be like:

```
<form action="/your-name/" method="post">
    `{% c_s_r_f_token %}`
    {{ form }}
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

```
**Now our form is created successfuly**
