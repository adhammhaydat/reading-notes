# Hashtables

hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. 

## Creating a Hash

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
4. Insert into the array at that index.

```
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16. 
```

## using a hash table with linked lists

create node that accepte hash table

```
hashMap.Add("Pioneer Square", 98104);
hashMap.Add("Alki Beach", 98116);

when print linked list it will be: 

Bucket 92: [{Pioneer Square: 98104} --> {Alki Beach: 98116}]

```

Hash maps do this to store values:

1. accept a key
2. calculate the hash of the key
3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
4. store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list


Hash maps do this to read value:

1. accept a key
2. calculate the hash of the key
3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
3. use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
4. search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given

### Internal Methods that using to handle the hash table in linked list:

1. .add()
2. find()
3. Contains()
4. GetHash()
