# Django REST Framework & Docker


Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.


A Docker container is an open source software development platform. Its main benefit is to package applications in containers, allowing them to be portable to any system running a Linux or Windows operating system (OS). A Windows machine can run Linux containers by using a virtual machine (VM).


Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.


**A baking analogy we can use here is as follows:**

* A Dockerfile is the recipe for a cake
* An image is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
* A docker-compose.yml says how to make the cake
* And the container is the actual, baked cake


## How to create Images

```
cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir code && cd code
$ mkdir python3.7 && cd python3.7
touch Dockerfile

import a base image to use for our image

docker image build .

```
`alpine` version which includes only the bare minimum needed to run Python


## Dockerized Django

inside the django Project

```
touch Dockerfile
$ touch docker-compose.yml


This Dockerfile has several commands. RUN, COPY, and ADD

```

we use FROM to install python:3.7-alpine as our base image and set two environment variables with ENV. The first, PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE will remove .pyc files from our container which is a good optimization. The second, PYTHONUNBUFFERED will buffer our output so it will look “normal” within Docker for us.

Then we used the WORKDIR command to create and set /code as our default directory within Docker. That means if in the future we want to run a command like python manage.py runserver we don’t have to also specify it should be run in the /code folder.

## Django REST Framework

### steps to create Django REST Framework project:

1. Django REST Framework is added by `pipenv install djangorestframework~=3.11.0` and add it to install apps in configuration file

2. create API app and add it to  install apps in configuration file

3. create another app and add it to install apps in configuration file

4. insid `project/url.py` make it like : 
```
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('api.urls')), # new
    path('', include('books.urls')),
]
```
5. Then create a urls.py file within the api app and make it like:
```
# api/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import BookAPIView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', BookAPIView.as_view()),
]
```

6. Within our views.py file, update it to look like the following
```
rom rest_framework import generics

from books.models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer


class BookAPIView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
```

7. Make a serializers.py file within our api app
```
from rest_framework import serializers

from books.models import Book


class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ('title', 'subtitle', 'author', 'isbn')
```
