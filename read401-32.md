# Permissions & Postgresql

***Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.***

## Object level permissions

REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.


## Setting the permission policy

If there is not specified authorization policy

```
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
   'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',
]
```

The default permission policy
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```
You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views.
```
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```


## API Reference

1. AllowAny: The AllowAny permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.

2. IsAuthenticated: The IsAuthenticated permission class will deny permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise.
This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to registered users.

3. IsAdminUser: The IsAdminUser permission class will deny permission to any user, unless user.is_staff is True in which case permission will be allowed.
This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to a subset of trusted administrators.

4. IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly: The IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly will allow authenticated users to perform any request. Requests for unauthorised users will only be permitted if the request method is one of the "safe" methods; GET, HEAD or OPTIONS.
This permission is suitable if you want to your API to allow read permissions to anonymous users, and only allow write permissions to authenticated users.
