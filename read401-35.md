# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected
### Undirected Graphs

`he undirected graph does not move in any direction.`

Vertices/Nodes = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

Edges = {(a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,e),(e,f)}

### Directed Graphs (Digraph)

A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

The directed graph above has six vertices and eight directed edges

Vertices = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

Edges = {(a,c),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,a),(d,e)(e,c)(e,f)}

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

### Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes

### Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

### Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Traversals

#### Algorithm

```
ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;
