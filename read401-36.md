## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received

1. Communicate: it mean asking the interviewer for each requirement

2. Restate the Question: tray to ask about the question to get all main point to solve it 

3. Ask About Edge Cases: Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them.

4. Ask About Test Cases: ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

5. Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

6. Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

7. Stuck? Ask for Help!: simple quistion: “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”

8. Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview: ask the human resources about the interview how it will be, get all information about it 

## 7 tips to ace a programming interview

1. Take a few minutes: 
Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.

2. Write down the steps of the solution:
don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard

3. Write pseudocode first. 

4. Don’t sweat the small stuff: like forget semicolon or something like that, don't wory it is fine, Brush it off and move on

5. Sit down. Be humble: A programming interview isn’t just a written exam, you should have work ethics

6. Come prepared: in a simple way re-cover what you have of information 

7. Review your work: in extra time check your solution if you can make it better.
