# Pythonisms

## Dunder Methods

In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.

As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”

```
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42
```

## Iterators

An iterator in Python is an object that contains a countable number of elements that can be iterated upon. In simpler words, we can say that Iterators are objects that allow you to traverse through all the elements of a collection and return one element at a time.

Iterators are containers for objects so that you can loop over the objects. In other words, you can run the "for" loop over the object. There are many iterators in the Python standard library. For example, list is an iterator and you can run a for loop over a list.

```
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return RepeaterIterator(self)

```


## Generators

Python provides a generator to create your own iterator function. A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values. In a generator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement.

Generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. They allow programmers to make an iterator in a fast, easy, and clean way. ... An iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon.

```
>>> generator_obj = repeater('Hey')
>>> next(generator_obj)

```
